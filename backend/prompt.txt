Given an image containing text, follow these steps:

1. Extract text from the image.
2. If no formulas are found in the text, return only false.
3. If formulas are found, extract and return the LaTeX code for each formula along with their corresponding headings in LaTeX format.

Example Output:

Formula 1
E = mc^2

Formuala 1 Explanation: 
This is Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula.

Formula 2:
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx = F(b) - F(a)

Formula 2 Explanation:
The fundamental theorem of calculus relates the definite integral of a function to its antiderivative.

Note: Replace the sample formulas and explanations with the actual extracted content from the image. The output should be in a LaTeX format for easy integration into LaTeX documents.
